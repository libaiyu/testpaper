delete the softwares that I donot use.

1, QQ (old)  2, xinqiyi新奇艺   3, winrar(old)

install the softwares that I need.

1, python344   2, git   3, wps   4, winrar(new)   5, QQ(new)
5, sublime (notepad++)

For python344, pip the modules that I need to use.

1, openpyxl  2, matplotlib  
3, send2trash  4, requests  5, beautifulsoup4  
6, selenium  7, PyPDF2  8, python-docx  9, imapclient  
10, pyzmail  11, twilio 12, pillow  13, pyautogui

when I install openpyxl, pip propmt me that the pip is not the newest one. So I upgrade it to 9.0. (just according to the prompt information to upgrade the pip.)

After install some necessary softwares, I use the ghost(in the usb memory) to clone the C drive.

Then continue to install the other softwares.

At first, I install the softwares that I need use during my course. 
1, MULTiSIM   2, MATLAB   3, WPS(word, excel)  4, Chinses input (陈桥五笔) it is my favorite, it is really good.  5, sublime (I try to use it in stead of notepad++.)

when I install python-docx, I met a trouble. there is no VC++ 10 in win 7 sys. I should install vc++ 10 first.  But after I install vc++ 10, there is still a software need to install before install python-docx. It is xml-3.7.3-py34-win7-32bit.whl. After install the wheel correctly. I can install the python-docx correctly.

When I met the trouble in install python-docx in python 3.4.4, I tried to install the new version python 3.6.0. But unfortunately, I install the matplotlib met the time out problem, but I tried install it again while I am having lunch. It is installed after I finish lunch. But when I failed to run the multi_gui program that can run well in python 3.4.4. I tried every mathods to fix it but I failed. so I delete all the python 3.6.0, install the python 3.4.4 and all the modules.
